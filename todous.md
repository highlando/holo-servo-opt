issues
--
check the exit conds
---
 * sign
 * to project or not to project
 * got it: term conds prescribe the speed, consistency levels them out, higher gamma amplifies
 * linear case --> gamma=0 (still oscillations for more iterations)
check the p
---
 * the sign of the nwtncorr (prob. OK)
 * value at t=0
 * sign in forwardproblem and ocp
do the linearization
---
 * to elim or not to elim the control -- we eliminate

debug the backwardsweep
---
 * for x=s=0, l1,l3 should be zero!!!
 * explicit formula for l2 in terms of p in my notes
